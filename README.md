# PySpark Projects

Welcome to the **PySpark Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of data analysis and processing projects built using **PySpark** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## About the Repository

This repository is designed to showcase various use cases and applications of PySpark for data processing. Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of PySpark's capabilities, ranging from data cleaning and transformation to advanced analytics.

in this repository contains two projects 
1 - A Simple project with basic operations using Pyspark
2 - A data analysis about Tariff apply by EUA in other countries  
## What I Learned

Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in working with large datasets using **PySpark**. Specifically, I learned:

- **Data Analysis**: How to explore, clean, and transform data efficiently with PySpark's DataFrame API.
- **ETL Processes**: The principles of ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Load) and how to implement these workflows in PySpark.
- **Data Processing**: Techniques for handling and processing large-scale data in a distributed computing environment.
- **PySpark Functions**: Leveraging PySpark's built-in functions for querying, aggregating, and manipulating structured data.
- **Integration with Jupyter Notebooks**: Using Jupyter Notebooks to create interactive and reproducible data analysis workflows.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Project Folders**: Each folder represents a standalone project, containing its Jupyter Notebook(s) and any associated data or resources.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks are used to illustrate the step-by-step implementation of PySpark workflows.

## Prerequisites

To run the projects in this repository, you will need:

- Python (3.x)
- Apache Spark
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (installable via `pip` or `conda`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabrielbprado/PySpark_Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder of your choice:
   ```bash
   cd PySpark_Projects/<project-folder>
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd PySpark_Projects/<project-folder>
